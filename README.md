## About Me

### Who am I?
Hi! I am Arek, I live in Poznan, Poland and I create web apps. I am a fan of new technologies, science and sport. I like travel and explore new places. I am a person who likes new challenges and does not give up before reaching the goal. I am a very creative person with a big imagination, so you can not expect boredom and lack of tasks with me.

### My story
My programming journey began in school when I created the first websites for friends and local companies. I participated in a couple of computer science competitions also with success. In high school I focused more on graphics and I created a lot of logotypes, posters and short movies with special effects also. I mainly used Gimp, Photoshop or After Effects for this. After high school I went to Poznan University of Technology, Physic Department where in addition to various engineering subjects and physics, I learned the basics of SQL, Java and C++, but my favorite language was still JavaScript. As an engineering thesis I created a browser game about playing the role of a sports team manager and managing it. After graduation I went abroad to the Netherlands where I worked in the logistics industry and became a team leader and was responsible for managing the team. Then after 1.5 years I went back to college to specialize IT management and went back to learning my favorite JavaScript to then become a full time programmer. During my study, I created projects like AXOffice, Clickscore, Neograd and more. I still want to grow and want to be a better programmer every day.

### My hobbies
Besides programming, my hobbies include keeping up with technological news and, above all, sports, both active and passive. I used to play team sports like volleyball and football now I run half marathons and the goal is still the marathon. I am also a fan of all kinds of sports statistics and reports, that’s why I have created a blog, channel and instagram SportStory.
I am also interested in personal development and management, so I like to read books on this subject and my favorite authors are Dale Carnegie, Brian Tracy and Napoleon Hill.

### My plans
I would like to become an expert in my field of programming, I’m going  to create new and better applications that will be used on a daily basis and I have a lot of ideas for these applications. It's important to step forward every day and increase my knowledge.
